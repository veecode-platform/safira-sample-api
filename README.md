# safira-sample-api

Sample project for getting started with Safira CLI.

## Using Insomnia

You can run Insomnia directly against a remote repo - **you do not need to clone a repo**, Insomnia uses `git` itself internally.

## How to Use

You should fork this repo and command "Create/Git Clone" directly from Insomnia's dashboard. You can commit/push changes to your API spec from Insomnia UI.
